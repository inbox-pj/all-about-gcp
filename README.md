## About
Cource will cover the key elements on GCP.


## Getting Started
### Regions
  - Specific geographical location to host your resources
  - Advantages
    - High Availability
    -   Low Latency
    -   Global Footprint
    -   Adhere to government regulations
### Zones
  - Increased availability and fault tolerance within same region
  - Each Zone has one or more discrete clusters
  - Clusters are distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data center
  - Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links
### Compute Engine
  - Create and manage lifecycle of Virtual Machine (VM) instances
  - Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances
  - Attach storage (& network storage) to your VM instances
  - Manage network connectivity and configuration for your VM instances
  - Compute Engine Machine Family
    -  **General Purpose (E2, N2, N2D, N1)** : Best price-performance ratio
        - Web and application servers, Small-medium databases, Dev environments
    -  **Memory Optimized (M2, M1)**: Ultra high memory workloads
        -  Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics
    -  **Compute Optimized (C2)**: Compute intensive workloads
        -  Gaming applications
